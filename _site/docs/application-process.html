<p>You will also need to complete, and upload a self-assessment to make sure we will be up-skilling. This is what is known as <strong>Initial Assessment</strong>. It will assess prior learning to establish the ‘starting point’, or baseline, for the apprentice. This informs how much of the apprenticeship training content the individual requires. It checks that the apprenticeship is an appropriate training programme for the individual and is about the whole standard.</p>
