<p>Each week we will work on incrementally developing a design for a complete enterprise system. Enterprise systems are often developed in layers with each layer being independently developed and tested before integration into the full system.</p>

<p>You will keep your work in your own git hub repository and incrementally add to this software as your design is developed.</p>

<p>In each class we will have a brief lecture and demonstration followed by a set of exercises to help you apply the technology or technique which has been introduced.</p>

<p>Once we have learnt a technology, we will begin to use it to develop a layer of our proposed system. Ultimately we will have a fully working enterprise App.</p>
