<p>When calculating the required amount of off-the-job training, the  apprentice’s statutory leave entitlement must be deducted.</p>

<p>Employees who work a 5-day week receive <strong>28 days paid statutory leave</strong> (20 days annual leave plus 8 bank holidays), which is the equivalent of  <strong>5.6 weeks of holiday</strong>. The apprentice’s own annual leave entitlement,  which may be higher than the statutory leave allowance, must not be  used in the calculation.</p>

<p>Therefore, for a full-time apprentice following a 12-month apprenticeship, off-the-job training is delivered over <strong>46.4 weeks</strong> (52 weeks minus 5.6  weeks of statutory leave).</p>

<p>An o<strong>ff-the-job learning activity</strong> must occur every calendar month during the practical period of an apprenticeship. This training can take different forms, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Face-to-face classroom learning</li>
  <li>Independent directed learning, which may include working on assessments or coursework</li>
  <li>Any other form of off-the-job activity that contributes to the apprentice’s learning and development outlined in the Training Place</li>
</ul>

<p>This is to ensure that apprentices remain engaged and continue progressing towards completing their apprenticeship.</p>
