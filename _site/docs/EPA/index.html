<p>Solent University, East Park Terrace, Southampton, SO14 0YN   <strong><a href="https://find-epao.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/courses/25/assessment-organisations/epa0325">End Point Assessor Organisation (EPAO) ID: EPA0325</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>Digital and technology solutions professional apprentices, their employers and training providers should read this document.</strong></p>

<p>A degree-apprenticeship awards a degree with the achievement of the apprenticeship. The degree learning outcomes must be aligned with the knowledge, skills and behaviours (KSBs) in the apprenticeship. The degree must be completed, passed and awarded alongside the digital and technology solutions professional degree-apprenticeship.</p>

<p class="note">To pass the BSc (Hons) degree you must pass the Apprenticeship (EPA) and vice versa</p>

<p>The apprentice must complete their training and meet the gateway requirements before starting their EPA. The EPA will assess occupational competence.</p>

<p><strong>To move into the EPA period you need to have completed and submitted the off-the-job tracker, Portfolio, EPA ready form &amp; Employer feedback reference - these will need to be checked before the final EPA assessments can be booked.</strong></p>

<p>We will encourage apprentices and their employers to think about suitable project areas for the Work Based Project end of the 2nd year (Level 5) and the beginning of the 3rd year (Level 6).</p>

<p>Support for the EPA <strong>(COM627)</strong> takes place in the final <strong>Digital and Technology Solutions Gateway COM628</strong> module which will also prepare you for Gateway EPA in completing your portfolio, gathering all required documents, getting ready to write-up the Work-based Project report and creating a “dry run” EPA presentation.</p>

<p class="note">We will continue to give you support post Gateway in preparation for the EPA assessments in the final <strong>EPA module COM628.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The EPA will be completed within a period lasting typically 3 months.</strong></p>

<p>Occupational competence is outlined by the EPA grade descriptors and determined, when assessed in line with this EPA plan, by an independent assessor who is an occupational expert and confirms the overall EPA grade.</p>

<p><strong>Assessment method 1 - project report with presentation, questions, and answers:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Fail</li>
  <li>Pass</li>
  <li>Distinction</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Assessment method 2 - professional discussion underpinned by a portfolio:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Fail</li>
  <li>Pass</li>
  <li>Distinction</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The result from each assessment method is combined to decide the overall degree-apprenticeship grade. The following grades are available for the degree-apprenticeship:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Fail</li>
  <li>Pass</li>
  <li>Merit</li>
  <li>Distinction</li>
</ul>

<p>An independent assessor must individually grade the project report with presentation, questions and answers and professional discussion underpinned by a portfolio in line with this EPA plan.</p>

<p>The EPAO (Solent University) must combine the individual assessment method grades to determine the overall EPA grade.</p>

<p>If the apprentice fails one assessment method or more, they will be awarded an overall fail.</p>

<p>To achieve an overall pass, the apprentice must achieve at least a pass in all the assessment methods. To achieve an overall EPA merit, the apprentice must achieve a pass in either assessment method or a distinction in the remaining method. To achieve an overall EPA distinction, the apprentice must achieve a distinction in both assessment methods.</p>

<p>Grades from individual assessment methods must be combined in the following way to determine the grade of the EPA overall.</p>

<h4 id="re-sits-and-re-takes">Re-sits and re-takes</h4>
<p>If the apprentice fails one or more assessment methods, they can take a re-sit or a re-take at their employer’s discretion. The apprentice’s employer needs to agree that a re-sit or re-take is appropriate. A re-sit does not need further learning, whereas a re-take does.</p>

<p>The apprentice should have a supportive action plan to prepare for a re-sit or a re-take.</p>

<p>The employer and EPAO (Solent University) agree the timescale for a re-sit or re-take. A re-sit is typically taken within 3 months of the EPA outcome notification. The timescale for a re-take is dependent on how much re-training is required and is typically taken within 6 months of the EPA outcome notification.</p>

<p>If the apprentice fails the project assessment method, they must amend the project output in line with the independent assessor’s feedback. The apprentice will be given 4 weeks to rework and submit the amended report.</p>

<p>Failed assessment methods must be re-sat or re-taken within a 6-month period from the EPA outcome notification, otherwise the entire EPA will need to be re-sat or re-taken in full.</p>

<p>Re-sits and re-takes are not offered to an apprentice wishing to move from pass to a higher grade.</p>

<p>The apprentice will get a maximum EPA grade of merit for a re-sit or re-take, unless the EPAO (Solent University) determines there are exceptional circumstances.</p>
