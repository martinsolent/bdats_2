<p>Solent University, East Park Terrace, Southampton, SO14 0YN   <strong><a href="https://find-epao.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/courses/25/assessment-organisations/epa0325">End Point Assessor Organisation (EPAO) ID: EPA0325</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>Project (AE1)</strong> - A project involves the apprentice completing a significant and defined piece of work that has a real business application and benefit.</p>

<p><strong>The project may be undertaken pre-gateway, however, the Project Report write-up must be completed after the apprentice has gone through the gateway and in the EPA period (3 months approx.)</strong></p>

<p>The apprentice will scope out and provide a summary of what the project will cover and will submit this at the gateway. This should demonstrate that the work-based project report will provide sufficient opportunity for the apprentice to meet the <strong>KSBs</strong> mapped to this method. The summary is not formally assessed and will typically be no longer than <strong>500 words</strong>.</p>

<p>The project proposal needs to include a summary of the project plan, research requirements, an overview of how the project will be planned to include timeframes and the date the work-based project report must be submitted to the independent assessor</p>
