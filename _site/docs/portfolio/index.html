<p>Throughout your apprenticeship, you will be continuously mapping your learning from on-programme modules and capturing potential evidence and documentation for your work-based portfolio. This process will use the provided template and will help you build a mental model of how your work aligns with the required Knowledge, Skills, and Behaviours (KSBs), all linked to your upskilling and learning activities.</p>

<p>Download the portfolio mapping template for your pathway and start adding and mapping your learning on and off the job throughout your apprenticeship. Work-based projects will help you get good coverage of the KSBs, especially the behaviours. When you go to EPA you will need 6 good pieces of portfolio evidence, so the expectations are that you will have more than 6 and then select the best ones to submit for the EPA assessment.</p>
