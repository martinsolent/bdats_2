The University recognises that from time to time you may experience personal circumstances which will make it difficult for you to attend class or submit your assessments on time. Those circumstances may be short term or longer-term and there are a number of ways the University can help you. It is vitally important you let us know you have problems as soon as possible so we can advise on the best course of action for your particular circumstances. We cannot normally take retrospective action; so telling us about your problems at the end of the year, or after your results have been released, is too late for us to help you. Make sure you speak to someone at the Student Hub as soon as you think you might be having difficulties. They will be able to guide you to the appropriate support. The following are the main ways in which the University can offer help to students who are experiencing personal problems that affect their ability to study. Solent EC Page . ",

Employees who work a 5-day week receive 28 days paid statutory leave (20 days annual leave plus 8 bank holidays), which is the equivalent of 5.6 weeks of holiday. The apprentice’s own annual leave entitlement, which may be higher than the statutory leave allowance, must not be used in the calculation. Therefore, for a full-time apprentice following a 12-month apprenticeship, off-the-job training is delivered over 46.4 weeks (52 weeks minus 5.6 weeks of statutory leave). An off-the-job learning activity must occur every calendar month during the practical period of an apprenticeship. This training can take different forms, such as: . | Face-to-face classroom learning | Independent directed learning, which may include working on assessments or coursework | Any other form of off-the-job activity that contributes to the apprentice’s learning and development outlined in the Training Place | .

Overview . In the professional discussion, an independent assessor and apprentice have a formal two-way conversation. It gives the apprentice the opportunity to demonstrate the KSBs mapped to this assessment method. The apprentice can refer to and illustrate their answers with evidence from their portfolio of evidence. Rationale . This assessment method is being used because: . | breadth of the core of the standard and opportunities to evidence across this throughout the duration of the programme | allows the opportunity to explore depth of understanding surrounding the relevant specialist KSBs. | . Delivery . The professional discussion must be structured to give the apprentice the opportunity to demonstrate the KSBs mapped to this assessment method to the highest available grade. An independent assessor must conduct and assess the professional discussion. The purpose of the independent assessor’s questions will be to explore the following topics and themes: . | Theme A: Underlying Principles | Theme B: Technical Solutions | Theme C: Innovation &amp; Response | Theme D: Legal, Ethics &amp; Landscape | . The EPAO (Solent University) must give an apprentice 14 days notice of the professional discussion. The independent assessor must have at least 2 weeks to review the supporting documentation. The apprentice must have access to their portfolio of evidence during the professional discussion. The apprentice can refer to and illustrate their answers with evidence from their portfolio of evidence however, the portfolio of evidence is not directly assessed. The professional discussion must last for 60 minutes. The independent assessor can increase the time of the professional discussion by up to 10%. This time is to allow the apprentice to respond to a question if necessary. The independent assessor must ask at least 4 questions. Follow-up questions are allowed where clarification is required. The independent assessor must use the questions from their EPAO’s question bank or create their own questions in-line with the EPAO’s training. The independent assessor must make the grading decision. The independent assessor must keep accurate records of the assessment. They must record: . | the apprentice’s answers to questions | the KSBs demonstrated in answers to questions. | the grade achieved.    | . Assessment location . The professional discussion must take place in a suitable venue selected by the EPAO (for example the EPAO’s or employer’s premises). The professional discussion can be conducted by video conferencing. The EPAO must have processes in place to verify the identity of the apprentice and ensure the apprentice is not being aided.

Introduction and overview . This page explains the requirements for end-point assessment (EPA) for the digital and technology solutions professional degree-apprenticeship. End-point assessment organisations (EPAOs) must follow this when designing and delivering the EPA. Digital and technology solutions professional apprentices, their employers and training providers should read this document. A degree-apprenticeship awards a degree with the achievement of the apprenticeship. The degree learning outcomes must be aligned with the knowledge, skills and behaviours (KSBs) in the apprenticeship. The degree must be completed, passed and awarded alongside the digital and technology solutions professional degree-apprenticeship. The apprentice must complete their training and meet the gateway requirements before starting their EPA. The EPA will assess occupational competence. A degree-apprenticeship must be delivered by a Higher Education Provider (HEP) that is on both the register of apprenticeship training providers (RoATP) and the register of end-point assessment organisations (RoEPAO). The apprentice’s employer must select an HEP who is on both registers. If the HEP is using a credit framework, the EPA must contribute to the total credit value, and must be delivered in line with this EPA plan. However, the number of credits devoted to EPA may vary across HEP’s. The recommended EPA contribution is 30 credits of the total credit value. A full-time digital and technology solutions professional apprentice typically spends 48 months on-programme (this means in training before the gateway). The apprentice must spend at least 12 months on-programme and complete the required amount of off-the-job training in line with the apprenticeship funding rules. This EPA should then be completed within an EPA period lasting typically 48 months. Occupational competence is outlined by the EPA grade descriptors and determined, when assessed in line with this EPA plan, by an independent assessor who is an occupational expert and confirms the overall EPA grade. Assessment method 1 - Project Report with presentation, questions and answers: . | Fail | Pass | Distinction | . Assessment method 2 - Professional Discussion underpinned by a portfolio: . | Fail | Pass | Distinction | . The result from each assessment method is combined to decide the overall degree-apprenticeship grade. The following grades are available for the degree-apprenticeship: . | Fail | Pass | Merit | Distinction | . EPA Summary . The apprentice must: . | complete training to develop the knowledge, skills and behaviours (KSBs) outlined in this degree-apprenticeship’s occupational standard . | complete training towards English and mathematics qualifications in line with the apprenticeship funding rules . | work towards all required elements of the digital and technology solutions professional degree-apprenticeship except undertaking the EPA . | The qualification required is:Digital and Technology Solutions Professional | | compile a portfolio of evidence | .

For the project report with presentation, questions and answers, the apprentice must submit a Project title and summary. To ensure the project allows the apprentice to meet the KSBs mapped to this assessment method to the highest available grade, the EPAO should sign-off the project’s title and scope at the gateway to confirm it is suitable. For the professional discussion underpinned by a portfolio, the apprentice must submit a portfolio of evidence. The apprentice must submit the gateway evidence to their EPAO, including any organisation specific policies and procedures requested by the EPAO. End-point assessment - typically 3 months .

The EPA is taken in the EPA period. The EPA period starts when the EPAO confirms the gateway requirements have been met and is typically 3 months. The EPAO should confirm the gateway requirements have been met and the EPA should start as quickly as possible. EPA Gateway . The apprentice’s employer must be content that the apprentice has attained sufficient KSBs to complete the degree-apprenticeship. The employer may take advice from the apprentice’s training provider, but the employer must make the decision. The apprentice will then enter the gateway. The apprentice must meet the gateway requirements before starting their EPA. They must: . | confirm they are ready to take the EPA | have achieved English and mathematics qualifications in line with the apprenticeship funding rules | have completed and passed all required elements of the Digital and Technology Solutions Professional degree-apprenticeship except the EPA | submit a Project title and summary for the project report with presentation, questions and answers | .

The portfolio of evidence is not directly assessed. It underpins the professional discussion and therefore should not be marked by the EPAO. EPAOs should review the portfolio of evidence in preparation for the professional discussion but are not required to provide feedback after this review of the portfolio. The apprentice must submit the gateway evidence to their EPAO, including any organisation specific policies and procedures requested by the EPAO. Project Report with presentation, questions and answers . Overview . A project involves the apprentice completing a significant and defined piece of work that has a real business application and benefit. NB - The project may be undertaken pre-gateway, however, the Project Report must be completed after the apprentice has gone through the gateway. A Digital and Technology Solutions Project may take years and not all projects experience a full life cycle, sometimes being abandoned for cost reasons or change of business strategy. A Digital Technology Solutions Professional may be one of a multidisciplined team and therefore may not control the timescale of the project. Therefore a project (or part project) cannot be designed or delayed to fit into the EPA timescale nor the specification of the EPAO as results can range from successful new recommendations on process, product or decommission. This cannot be predicted. The project must give the apprentice the opportunity to demonstrate the KSBs mapped to this assessment method. The project must meet the needs of the employer’s business and be relevant to the apprentice’s occupation and apprenticeship. The EPAO must confirm that it provides the apprentice with the opportunity to demonstrate the KSBs mapped to this assessment method to the highest available grade. The EPAO must refer to the grading descriptors to ensure that projects are pitched appropriately. This assessment method has 2 components: . | Project with report | presentation with questions and answers | . Rationale . This assessment method is being used because a project is a fundamental activity within the sectors in which a DTSP works. Every specialism within the DTSP apprenticeship works within a project-based approach and so this is a valid way of measuring competence. The project may be undertaken pre-gateway, however, the Project Report must be completed after the apprentice has gone through the gateway. A Digital and Technology Solutions Project may take years and not all projects experience a full life cycle, sometimes being abandoned for cost reasons or change of business strategy. A Digital Technology Solutions Professional may be one of a multidisciplined team and therefore may not control the timescale of the project. Therefore a project (or part project) cannot be designed or delayed to fit into the EPA timescale nor the specification of the EPAO as results can range from successful new recommendations on process, product or decommission. This cannot be predicted. Component 1: Project with a project report . Delivery . The project report with presentation, questions and answers must be structured to give the apprentice the opportunity to demonstrate the KSBs mapped to this assessment method to the highest available grade. The apprentice’s project can be based on any of the following: . | a specific problem | a recurring issue | an idea or opportunity | . To ensure the project allows the apprentice to meet the KSBs mapped to this assessment method to the highest available grade, the EPAO should sign-off the project’s title and scope at the gateway to confirm it is suitable. The project output must be in the form of a report. The apprentice must start the project report after the gateway. They must complete and submit the to the EPAO by the end of week report 12 of the EPA period. The employer should ensure the apprentice has the time and resources, within this period, to plan and complete their project. The apprentice must complete their project and the production of its components unaided. The apprentice may work as part of a team to complete the project which could include technical internal or external support. However, the project report must be the apprentice’s own work and reflective of their own role and contribution. The apprentice and their employer must confirm that the project report is the apprentice’s own work when it is submitted. The report must include at least: . | an introduction | the scope of the project (including key performance indicators and stakeholder engagement) | how the outcomes would be achieved | a project plan | research and findings | project outcomes | recommendations and conclusions. | . The project report has a word count of 6000 words. A tolerance of 10% above or below the word count is allowed at the apprentice’s discretion. Appendices, references and diagrams are not included in this total. The project report must map, in an appendix, how it evidences the KSBs mapped to this assessment method. Component 2: Presentation with questions . Delivery . In the presentation with questions the apprentice delivers a presentation to an independent assessor on a set subject. The independent assessor must ask questions following the presentation. This gives the apprentice the opportunity to demonstrate the KSBs mapped to this assessment method. The apprentice must prepare and submit their presentation speaker notes and supporting materials presentation with questions and answers. The independent assessor must ask questions after the presentation. The presentations must include: . | an overview of the project | the project scope (including key performance indicators) | summary of actions undertaken by the apprentice | project outcomes and how these were achieved | . The apprentice must prepare and submit their presentation speaker notes and supporting materials to the EPAO at the same time as the report by the end of week 12 of the EPA period. The apprentice must notify the EPAO, at that point, of any technical requirements for the presentation.

Performance in the EPA determines the overall grade of: . | Fail | Pass | Merit | Distinction | . An independent assessor must individually grade the project report with presentation, questions and answers and professional discussion underpinned by a portfolio in line with this EPA plan. The EPAO must combine the individual assessment method grades to determine the overall EPA grade. If the apprentice fails one assessment method or more, they will be awarded an overall fail. To achieve an overall pass, the apprentice must achieve at least a pass in all the assessment methods. To achieve an overall EPA merit, the apprentice must achieve a pass in either assessment method and a distinction in the remaining method. To achieve an overall EPA distinction, the apprentice must achieve a distinction in both assessment methods. Grades from individual assessment methods must be combined in the following way to determine the grade of the EPA overall. | PROJECT REPORT WITH PRESENTATION, QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS | PROFESSIONAL DISCUSSION UNDERPINNED BY A PORTFOLIO | OVERALL GRADING | . | Fail | Any grade | Fail | . | Any grade | Fail | Fail | . | Pass | Pass | Pass | . | Pass | Distinction | Merit | . | Distinction | Pass | Merit | . | Distinction | Distinction | Distinction | . Re-sits and re-takes . If the apprentice fails one or more assessment methods they can take a re-sit or a re-take at their employer’s discretion. The apprentice’s employer needs to agree that a re-sit or re-take is appropriate. A re-sit does not need further learning, whereas a re-take does. The apprentice should have a supportive action plan to prepare for a re-sit or a re-take. The employer and EPAO agree the timescale for a re-sit or re-take. A re-sit is typically taken within 3 months of the EPA outcome notification. The timescale for a re-take is dependent on how much re-training is required and is typically taken within 6 months of the EPA outcome notification. If the apprentice fails the project assessment method, they must amend the project output in line with the independent assessor’s feedback. The apprentice will be given 4 weeks to rework and submit the amended report. Failed assessment methods must be re-sat or re-taken within a 6-month period from the EPA outcome notification, otherwise the entire EPA will need to be re-sat or re-taken in full. Re-sits and re-takes are not offered to an apprentice wishing to move from pass to a higher grade. The apprentice will get a maximum EPA grade of merit for a re-sit or re-take, unless the EPAO determines there are exceptional circumstances. Roles and responsibilities . Reasonable adjustments . The EPAO must have reasonable adjustments arrangements for the EPA. This should include: . | how an apprentice qualifies for reasonable adjustment | what reasonable adjustments may be made | . Adjustments must maintain the validity, reliability and integrity of the EPA as outlined in this EPA plan. Internal quality assurance . Internal quality assurance refers to the strategies, policies and procedures that EPAOs must have in place to ensure valid, consistent and reliable end-point assessment decisions. EPAOs for this EPA must adhere to all requirements within the roles and responsibilities table and: . | appoint independent assessors who also: | have relevant experience of the occupation to at least occupational level 6 gained in the last 3 years | . Value for money Affordability of the EPA will be aided by using at least some of the following: . | utilising digital remote platforms to conduct applicable assessment methods | using the employer’s premises | conducting assessment methods on the same day | .

    "content": "Topics 1 &amp; 2 . Will introduce the module and look at a few additional JavaScript topics that you may not have covered in Level 4. This will include JavaScript arrays and look at JavaScript objects, both of which are critical for understanding JSON, which will be very important throughout the module. In addition, we will revise event-handling and look at ECMAScript 6 arrow functions and look at JavaScript classes. Topic 3 . Will be introduced to server-side JavaScript, making use of Node.js. We will look at the general concept of HTTP web servers, and how to create a simple web server in Node.js. Having done that we will then look at Express, which is one of the leading frameworks form Node.js server development. We will also examine web APIs (which are very easy to create with Express) and start looking at how we can represent data in a structured way with JSON. We will also look at HTTP requests and the different HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, allowing us to develop APIs making use of the REST architecture. Topic 4 . Will extend our examination of Express by considering how we can interact with an SQL database. You will see how a web server can act as an intermediate between a client (front-end) and a database, reading in data from the client and sending it on to a database as an SQL query - as well as formatting database results in JSON to send back to the client. Topic 5 . Having considered the basics of Node and Express, we will move back to the front-end and consider how we can interact with a Node/Express web API from client-side JavaScript. Specifically, we will look at the development technique of AJAX, which allows client-side, front-end JavaScript to send requests to web servers and process the response sent back from the server. Our examination of AJAX will consider how to send requests to a server (using the fetch API), concepts such as promises and async/await, and how to parse (interpret) the JSON sent back from the server and present it to the user in a user-friendly way. Topic 6 . Will extend our look at AJAX applications by considering how we can dynamically create content in an AJAX front-end (for example, if a set of songs in a music application is sent back from a server, how can we create ‘Download’ buttons for each song?) This will involve examining the Document Object Model (DOM). Topic 7 . As an interactive and engaging example of AJAX clients, we will look at web mapping and consider how we can embed an interactive map, with markers, on an AJAX-front end. We will also look at how a mapping application can communicate with a server and convert the JSON returned from the server into map markers. This will make use of the Leaflet library and OpenStreetMap. Topic 8 . Will look at some further Node/Express concepts and look at how we can develop a well-designed Node and Express application making use of routes, controllers and middleware. Topic 9 . Will look at how we can add authentication to an Express web server and develop a login system. This will make use of the express-session module. Depending on how you are progressing, we will then extend our look at login systems by considering the Passport authentication framework, a more advanced but also flexible approach to authentication which can be adapted to work with third-party authentication providers such as Google or Facebook.

Solent Safeguarding Policy . The University is committed to ensuring a safe and supportive environment for students, staff, and visitors. The University recognises that in the course of its activities, there are circumstances in which children, adults with care or support needs or students at risk come onto University premises at both campuses or have contact with University students, staff, or contractors. https://students.solent.ac.uk/student-hub/safeguarding . Equality and Diversity . Solent University aims to foster a community with a culture of mutual trust, fairness, harmony, and respect devoid of hatred and intolerance. It is committed to the elimination of all forms of both direct and indirect discrimination and will take appropriate action wherever possible to enforce its equality in its student equality, diversity, and inclusion policy. https://students.solent.ac.uk/student-hub/equality-and-diversity . Prevent . Prevent is one of four strands that make up the government’s counter-terrorism strategy called CONTEST. The Prevent duty is a new statutory duty to have “due regard to the need to prevent individuals from being drawn into terrorism”. The Prevent duty guidance provided by the government requires universities to assess the level of risk that people may be drawn into terrorism and to have suitable policies, procedures, or arrangements in place to mitigate those risks. On 1 April 2018 the Office for Students (OfS) took over from the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) in the role of regulating English higher education providers on behalf of all students, including the role of working with universities to ensure the appropriate Prevent duty policies, procedures and arrangements are in place, and following an OfS Prevent monitoring framework for this purpose. https://students.solent.ac.uk/student-hub/prevent .

    "doc": "Off the Job Hours",
    "title": "Apprenticeships: off-the-job training",
    "content": ". Off-the-job training is a statutory requirement for an English apprenticeship and must make up at least 20% of an apprentice’s normal working hours (paid hours excluding overtime) over the planned duration of the apprenticeship. It is training that is received by the apprentice, during the apprentice’s normal working hours, for the purpose of achieving the knowledge, skills, and behaviours of the approved apprenticeship referenced in the apprenticeship agreement. How employers and training providers should meet the off-the-job training requirement for apprentices, with some best practice examples. GOV.UK., 2023. Apprenticeships: off-the-job training [viewed 30 October 2023]. Available from: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apprenticeships-off-the-job-training . An apprenticeship is a job with a formal programme of off-the-job training. Off-the-job training is an essential component, and a legal requirement, of an apprenticeship. In England, to be eligible for government funding, a minimum threshold has been set. All new full-time apprentices (those who work at least 30 hours per week) must spend at least 20% of their normal working hours, over the planned duration of the apprenticeship practical period, on off-the-job training.For calculation purposes only, normal working hours are capped at 30 hours per week, which equates to an average of 6 hours of off-the-job training per week (i.e. 20% of 30 hours). Apprentices can work for more than 30 hours per week for their employer. If an individual works less than 30 hours per week, they are considered to be a part-time apprentice and their training programme must be extended, as per the apprenticeship funding rules. At least 20% of their normal working hours, over this extended duration, must be spent on off-the-job training . It can be flexible and doesn’t have to mean 1 day out of the workplace every week. For example, training could take place: . | online | at the apprentice’s place of work | at a college or university or with a training provider | Or it could be a combination of these options. | . The frequency can vary, for example: . | 1 day a week | part of a working day | blocks of time | For instance, some apprenticeships begin with a block of training to get the apprentice work-ready. | . You can agree on a suitable training schedule to suit the needs of your business with your training provider. English and maths . Your apprentice may also need to study for maths and English qualifications as part of their apprenticeship. You must allow your apprentice time to study for this within their normal working hours. Studying English and maths is not counted as part of the 20% minimum off-the-job training requirement. Apprenticeship Training Plan . Previously called a commitment statement, the training plan sets out the training to be delivered and the commitment of all three parties (provider, employer and apprentice) to the programme. It can also be used to record key details such as the employer’s agreement to release the apprentice for their off-the-job training. The apprenticeship funding rules detail what information is needed in the training plan and all parties must keep a current signed and dated version. This must include: . | the planned content and schedule for training | what is expected and offered by the employer, the training organisation and the apprentice | how to resolve queries or complaints | .

    "content": ". Solent University, East Park Terrace, Southampton, SO14 0YN   End Point Assessor Organisation (EPAO) ID: EPA0325 . Digital and technology solutions professional apprentices, their employers and training providers should read this document. A degree-apprenticeship awards a degree with the achievement of the apprenticeship. The degree learning outcomes must be aligned with the knowledge, skills and behaviours (KSBs) in the apprenticeship. The degree must be completed, passed and awarded alongside the digital and technology solutions professional degree-apprenticeship. To pass the BSc (Hons) degree you must pass the Apprenticeship (EPA) and vice versa . The apprentice must complete their training and meet the gateway requirements before starting their EPA. The EPA will assess occupational competence. To move into the EPA period you need to have completed and submitted the off-the-job tracker, Portfolio, EPA ready form &amp; Employer feedback reference - these will need to be checked before the final EPA assessments can be booked. We will encourage apprentices and their employers to think about suitable project areas for the Work Based Project end of the 2nd year (Level 5) and the beginning of the 3rd year (Level 6). Support for the EPA (COM627) takes place in the final Digital and Technology Solutions Gateway COM628 module which will also prepare you for Gateway EPA in completing your portfolio, gathering all required documents, getting ready to write-up the Work-based Project report and creating a “dry run” EPA presentation. We will continue to give you support post Gateway in preparation for the EPA assessments in the final EPA module COM628. The EPA will be completed within a period lasting typically 3 months. Occupational competence is outlined by the EPA grade descriptors and determined, when assessed in line with this EPA plan, by an independent assessor who is an occupational expert and confirms the overall EPA grade. Assessment method 1 - project report with presentation, questions, and answers: . | Fail | Pass | Distinction | . Assessment method 2 - professional discussion underpinned by a portfolio: . | Fail | Pass | Distinction | . The result from each assessment method is combined to decide the overall degree-apprenticeship grade. The following grades are available for the degree-apprenticeship: . | Fail | Pass | Merit | Distinction | . An independent assessor must individually grade the project report with presentation, questions and answers and professional discussion underpinned by a portfolio in line with this EPA plan. The EPAO (Solent University) must combine the individual assessment method grades to determine the overall EPA grade. If the apprentice fails one assessment method or more, they will be awarded an overall fail. To achieve an overall pass, the apprentice must achieve at least a pass in all the assessment methods. To achieve an overall EPA merit, the apprentice must achieve a pass in either assessment method or a distinction in the remaining method. To achieve an overall EPA distinction, the apprentice must achieve a distinction in both assessment methods. Grades from individual assessment methods must be combined in the following way to determine the grade of the EPA overall. | PROJECT REPORT WITH PRESENTATION, QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS | PROFESSIONAL DISCUSSION UNDERPINNED BY A PORTFOLIO | OVERALL GRADING | . | Fail | Any grade | Fail | . | Any Grade | Fail | Fail | . | Pass | Pass | Pass | . | Pass | Distinction | Merit | . | Distinction | Pass | Merit | . | Distinction | Distinction | Merit | . Re-sits and re-takes . If the apprentice fails one or more assessment methods, they can take a re-sit or a re-take at their employer’s discretion. The apprentice’s employer needs to agree that a re-sit or re-take is appropriate. A re-sit does not need further learning, whereas a re-take does. The apprentice should have a supportive action plan to prepare for a re-sit or a re-take. The employer and EPAO (Solent University) agree the timescale for a re-sit or re-take. A re-sit is typically taken within 3 months of the EPA outcome notification. The timescale for a re-take is dependent on how much re-training is required and is typically taken within 6 months of the EPA outcome notification. If the apprentice fails the project assessment method, they must amend the project output in line with the independent assessor’s feedback. The apprentice will be given 4 weeks to rework and submit the amended report. Failed assessment methods must be re-sat or re-taken within a 6-month period from the EPA outcome notification, otherwise the entire EPA will need to be re-sat or re-taken in full. Re-sits and re-takes are not offered to an apprentice wishing to move from pass to a higher grade. The apprentice will get a maximum EPA grade of merit for a re-sit or re-take, unless the EPAO (Solent University) determines there are exceptional circumstances. ",

    "title": "Embedding English &amp; Maths",
    "content": "Maths and English play crucial roles in the tech and digital industries and they are embedded in various aspects of the field. Maths provides the logical and analytical foundation for solving complex problems in software engineering, while English and communication skills are vital for expressing ideas, documenting processes, and collaborating effectively with team members and stakeholders. Both are integral to the success of digital projects. Mathematics: . | Algorithm Analysis and Design: Mathematical concepts are fundamental to analysing algorithms for efficiency and designing optimal solutions. Big O notation and other mathematical tools help in evaluating the time and space complexity of algorithms. | Data Structures: Mathematics, particularly set theory, is used in the design and analysis of data structures. Understanding mathematical concepts helps engineers choose the most efficient data structures for specific tasks. | Cryptography: Encryption algorithms, an essential part of securing data, are heavily based on mathematical principles. Number theory and other branches of mathematics are applied in the development of cryptographic protocols. | Graphics and Visualisation: Mathematics, especially linear algebra, is foundational in computer graphics and visualization. Transformations, projections, and other graphical manipulations are expressed mathematically to render images on a screen. | Machine Learning and AI: Mathematical concepts, such as statistics, linear algebra, and calculus, form the backbone of machine learning algorithms. Engineers use mathematical models to train and optimize algorithms for tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, etc. | Databases: Database management systems often involve mathematical concepts like relational algebra and set theory for designing and querying databases. | Networking: Mathematical models are used to optimise and analyse network protocols and data transmission. | . English . | Documentation: Clear and concise documentation is essential in software development. Developers need strong written communication skills to document code, APIs, and system architecture. | Requirements Gathering: Understanding user requirements is a crucial step in software development. Effective communication with clients, stakeholders, and team members, often involving written documentation, is essential to gather and clarify requirements. | Code Comments and Readability: Writing code that is easy to read and understand is a critical skill. Engineers use comments and documentation to explain the logic behind the code, making it accessible to others who may work on the same project. | Collaboration and Team Communication: Software development is a collaborative process. Clear communication through emails, chat, and documentation helps teams coordinate their efforts and work efficiently. | Testing and Bug Reports: Writing clear bug reports and test cases requires strong written communication skills. This helps in conveying issues to the development team and ensuring that bugs are addressed effectively. | . Maths Module Mapping . | Module | Level 4 - First Year | . | COM411 Problem Solving through Programming | Sets are covered in the context of a python program. Unions and intersections are explained. Ordered lists and data – technically vectors, although not framed as linear algebra.General logic and Boolean logic as normal in programming. Assessment involves some mathematical operations, such as working out the average across subsections of a dataset etc. Assessment involves some minor plotting and visualisation of data. | . | COM412 Introduction to Networks | Has all the mathematics required for network addressing including Number systems especially Binary, and Hexadecimal with all conversions to and from Decimal. Boolean Operators and practising Bitwise AND. This is then applied by calculating Subnet masks and dividing networks into subnets. Using exponents to calculate the number of Host addresses available on a subnet and calculating the number of subnetworks available from a given network address. | . | COM421 Data Structures &amp; Algorithms | Algorithm complexity (Big O notation). Calculations of hash codes for hash tables. Binary trees and sorting algorithms | . | Module | Level 5 - Second Year | . | COM526 Introduction to AI | Probability, vectors, linear algebra | . | Module | Level 6 - Third Year | . | COM618 Data Science | Probability, statistical analysis, linear equation, Bayes’ Theorem, Descriptive Statistics (summarising and describing the main features of a dataset (mean, median, mode, range, variance, standard deviation), regression analysis.Additionally, tools and libraries in programming languages like Python (e.g., NumPy, SciPy) provide efficient implementations of these mathematical concepts. | . | COM624 Machine Learning | Linear AlgebraLinear and Polynomial RegressionsDescriptive Statistics 2D and 3D geometric analysis and visualisationStatistical modellingMatrix operations such as convolutions | . English Module Mapping . We deliver an introduction to writing clearly and concisely at Level 4 for all our apprentices in COM423.
