**WE DO NOT HAVE JANUARY STARTS ON BDATS**

January starters (ONLY) have Summer 2022 to select an appropriate work-based project in agreement with your manager/workplace if possible carrying out some initial expiration ready to work on and compile your project in the Synoptic Project from January - May 2023 - if you due to study this module from Jan 2023 you will have access to the COM625 SOL: [COM625_7022510974](https://learn.solent.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=48508)

We also encourage you to work on curating/updating your portfolio and off-the-job-tracker which is needed for your Endpoint Assessment EPA.

You will not have any delivered content/classes or graded work to submit during this period although you will be required to make three check-ins with a brief summary of your progress: The end of June, July and the beginning of September - details below.

The Synoptic Project is designed to provide you with the opportunity to conduct a self-managed project of significant scale and complexity. The project should reflect theory and practice drawn from the named award being undertaken by you and should also reflect your career pathway and work experience. You will be encouraged to undertake a project that is related to your profession. The completed project should reflect your ability to plan, execute and present the findings from an endeavour of you and your employer's choosing

Unlike an academic dissertation or research paper, projects on apprenticeship programmes are live work-based projects that are managed in the workplace across a significant period of time. The project is introduced early in the academic programme to ensure that apprentices and employers can identify a suitable topic that adds value to the organisation. Ideally, the synoptic project will be considered in scope and address a strategic business need or issue.

As part of the EPA, the independent assessor will review the apprentice’s project report. The project report should summarise the development, implementation and impact of the project:

* Define - evidence of purpose/goal and objectives
* Design - evidence of planning prior to the project start and controls
* Do - analysis of key stages, achievement of outcomes, strategies to overcome barriers/challenges and use of project management tools
* Review – evaluation of the success and impact of the project and consideration of longer-term benefits and implications

In addition, the external assessor will look for evidence of:

Alignment to a business need or problem; alignment to organisational strategy; evidence of stakeholder communications; risk, resource and financial considerations; visual plans; controls and impact.

Full details from the Apprenticeship Standard assessment are given [here](https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/media/1073/digital_and_technology_solutions_professional.pdf). This should be read for particular requirements for the appropriate career pathway. High-level descriptors of typical projects are given within the published standard for each of the specialisms. It is anticipated that the project will take place over a period of around six months. This project forms part of the endpoint assessment (EPA) for the overall achievement of this Integrated Apprenticeship.

See full details in the published government standard.

## Project Outline

To get your project going you need to write up a summary of what you intend to do and offer **background and context**. You will also need to highlight that you have **discussed and agreed with your employer** about the feasibility of undertaking this project including any potential issues (presented below) you are able to **do the practical side of your project in your on-the-job hours** and you will be able to complete the project within the timeframe.

It should be no more than two sides of A4 this need to be done before you start the project of before you start the COM625 module.

### Considerations for the selection of an appropriate project

The subject and technical focus of the project is defined by your selection of topic area in conjunction with your employer and is a work-based project that broadly represents the skills, knowledge, and behaviours of the apprenticeship standard. However, this must be demonstrably drawn from, and extend the theory and practice encompassed by your career pathway and profession.  All projects must produce specific artefacts that demonstrate intellectual, practical skills and appropriate behaviours in the subject domain.

For the topic chosen, any issues with confidentiality and/or security will also be addressed between the university, employer, and you the apprentice, allowing for projects of business value to be undertaken using real data. The assessment of the synoptic project should include your employer’s assessment against the common criteria for the project.

In addition, you will acquire knowledge and skills associated with the gathering and interpretation of literature, the development of an appropriate project methodology, project planning, written and verbal reporting of project outcomes, and the use of references. The project must take into consideration relevant ethical, legal, and other professional issues in its conception. Particularly it must address any issues associated with intellectual property.
