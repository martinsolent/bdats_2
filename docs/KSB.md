### Cyber Security Specialist

A cyber security analyst is responsible for the implementation, maintenance and support of the security controls that protect an organisation’s systems and data assets from threats and hazards. They ensure that security technologies and practices are operating in accordance with the organisation’s policies and standards to provide continued protection. They require a broad understanding of network infrastructure, software and data to identify where threat and hazard can occur. They are responsible for performing periodic vulnerability assessments to evaluate the organisation’s ongoing security posture and will provide visibility to management of the main risks and control status on an ongoing basis. They respond to security incidents and implement resolution activities across the organisation.

**Skills**

**Be able to:**

- Analyse and evaluate     security threats and vulnerabilities to planned and installed information     systems or services and identify how these can be mitigated against.
- Perform security risk     assessments for a range of information systems and propose solutions.
- Develop a security case     against recognised security threats, and recommend mitigation, security     controls and appropriate processes.
- Define and justify a user     access policy for an information system given knowledge of the system     architecture, security requirements and threat/risk environment. This     should be in terms of what they can do, resources they can access, and     operations they are allowed to perform.
- Perform a business impact     analysis in response to a security incident and follow a disaster recovery     plan to meet elements of a given business continuity policy.
- Conduct a range of cyber     security audit activities to demonstrate security control effectiveness


**Technical Knowledge**

- How to recognise and     assess risk including performing a risk assessment.
- How to apply penetration     testing e ectively and how it contributes to assurance.
- The di erent approaches to     risk treatment and management in practice.
- What the ‘cyber security     culture’ in an organisation is, and how it may contribute to security     risk.

### Data analyst

The primary role of a data analyst is to collect, organise and study data to provide new business insight. They are responsible for providing up-to-date, accurate and relevant data analysis for the organisation. They are typically involved with managing, cleansing, abstracting and aggregating data across the network infrastructure. They have a good understanding of data structures, software development procedures and the range of analytical tools used to undertake a wide range of standard and custom analytical studies, providing data solutions to a range of business issues. They document and report the results of data analysis activities making recommendations to improve business performance. They need a broad grounding in technology solutions to be effective in their role.

### Network Engineer

The primary role of a network engineer is to design, install, maintain and support communication networks within an organisation or between organisations. They need to maintain high levels of network performance and availability for their users, such as staff, clients, customers and suppliers. They will understand network configuration, cloud, network administration and monitoring tools, and be able to give technical advice and guidance. As part of their role they need to be proficient in technology solutions as they will analyse system requirements to ensure the network and its services operate to desired levels. They will need to understand the data traffic and transmission across the network and they have a major role to play in ensuring network security.

- Plan, design, build and     test a simple network to a requirement specification that includes hubs,     switches, routers and wireless user devices, applying appropriate security     products and processes.
- Identify the key     characteristics of a new network service and develop estimates of the     expected traffic intensity and traffic load that the network must support.
- Determine the minimum     network capacity of planned networks to meet network requirements.
- Design, build, test,     configure and optimise a distributed network (more than 1 sub-net),     including switches, routers and firewalls to meet given requirements.
- Analyse network     performance and troubleshoot typical problems in networks.
- Identify and evaluate     network security risks and incorporate appropriate security products and     processes into network designs to increase security, resilience and     dependability.

**Technical Knowledge**

- The main factors that     affect network performance (e.g. the relationship between bandwidth,     number of users, nature of traffic, contention).
- Failure modes in protocols     (e.g. why a protocol may ‘hang’ and the effect of data communication     errors).
- The ways to improve     performance (e.g. application of traffic shaping, changes to architecture     to avoid bottlenecks, network policy that prohibit streaming protocols).
- The issues that may arise     in the day-to-day operation of networks and how to resolve them.
