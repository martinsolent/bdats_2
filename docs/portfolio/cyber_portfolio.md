# Cyber Security Portfolio
*A Cyber Security Analyst leads in the work to define, implement and maintain security products and systems within an organisation’s policies and service level agreements. They will need to analyse and understand the points of vulnerability within IT systems and a proactive and agile approach to maintain high levels of systems and organisational security. They will monitor security performance using tools, statistical reporting and analysis, using the output of monitoring to problem solve, propose improvements and implement changes to meet service level requirements. A Cyber Security Analyst leads technical implementation of security infrastructures and technical designs, including producing cost and timescale estimates and identifying risks. After implementation they take ownership for obtaining the information required to diagnose and resolve more complex problems and escalations such as security incidents and business recovery. They engage with third parties to jointly resolve in-depth product issues where necessary and completing cyber risk assessments.*
[Cyber Security Analyst Apprenticeship ST0119 v1.2 2023](Cyber Security Analyst Apprenticeship(ST0119 v1.2 2023)

Your portfolio should evidence your competence against the KSBs listed in the standard.
It must be mapped to six distinct items, each showcasing different aspects of your role and learning.

Choose projects that cover a range of activities, such as:
* Cyber Security
* Ethical and legal compliance
* Organisational, business and team collaboration

Ensure all examples are authentic, anonymised if necessary and have organisation clearance to submit.

Explain why you did it, what you learned, and how it impacted the project or organisation.
Use reflective writing to show growth and understanding.

Include examples that show how your skills have developed over time.
Highlight how you’ve responded to feedback or adapted to new challenges.

Be ready to talk through each item, justify your decisions, and explain how they meet the KSBs.
Practice answering questions that ask you to expand, clarify, or compare your work.
 
## Portfolio Evidence Overview (6x items)

This section provides a structured list of example portfolio evidence items, grouped under the four End-Point Assessment (EPA) themes defined in the Cyber Security apprenticeship standard. These examples are designed to support apprentices and employers in identifying suitable work-based projects and artefacts that demonstrate the required Knowledge, Skills, and Behaviours (KSBs).

Each theme reflects a key area of competence: The portfolio items listed under each theme are examples only and should be adapted to reflect the apprentice’s actual work and context. They are intended to guide the development of a strong, well-evidenced portfolio that supports a successful EPA. The apprenticeship standard outlines both core and pathway duties, each comprising a set of Knowledge, Skills, and Behaviours (KSBs) aligned to specific criteria or activities. These may also be helpful when selecting appropriate portfolio items for documentation.

**Colour Cyber Table**

Throughout the apprenticeship you will need to collate a portfolio of work mapped to the Standard’s KSBs, in Gateway COM628 module, the final on-programme module in 3rd (Level 6), you will submit a Portfolio of select a final 6 discrete pieces for the Professional Discussion underpinned by a portfolio assessment element 2 (AE2)

•	apprentices must compile a portfolio of evidence during the on-programme period of the apprenticeship.
•	it must contain evidence related to the KSBs that will be assessed by the professional discussion.
•	the portfolio of evidence will typically contain 6 discrete pieces of evidence.
•	evidence must be mapped against the KSBs.
•	evidence may be used to demonstrate more than one KSB; a qualitative as opposed to quantitative approach is suggested.
•	evidence sources may include:
•	workplace documentation/records, for example workplace policies/procedures, records
•	witness statements
•	assignments
•	annotated photographs
•	video clips (maximum total duration 10 minutes); the apprentice must be in view and identifiable.
