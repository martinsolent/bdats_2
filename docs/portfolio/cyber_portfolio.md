# Cyber Security Portfolio
*A Cyber Security Analyst leads in the work to define, implement and maintain security products and systems within an organisation’s policies and service level agreements. They will need to analyse and understand the points of vulnerability within IT systems and a proactive and agile approach to maintain high levels of systems and organisational security. They will monitor security performance using tools, statistical reporting and analysis, using the output of monitoring to problem solve, propose improvements and implement changes to meet service level requirements. A Cyber Security Analyst leads technical implementation of security infrastructures and technical designs, including producing cost and timescale estimates and identifying risks. After implementation they take ownership for obtaining the information required to diagnose and resolve more complex problems and escalations such as security incidents and business recovery. They engage with third parties to jointly resolve in-depth product issues where necessary and completing cyber risk assessments.*

Your portfolio should evidence your competence against the KSBs listed in the standard.
It must be mapped to six distinct items, each showcasing different aspects of your role and learning.

Choose projects that cover a range of activities, such as:
* Cyber Security
* Ethical and legal compliance
* Organisational, business and team collaboration

Ensure all examples are authentic, anonymised if necessary and have organisation clearance to submit.

Explain why you did it, what you learned, and how it impacted the project or organisation.
Use reflective writing to show growth and understanding.

Include examples that show how your skills have developed over time.
Highlight how you’ve responded to feedback or adapted to new challenges.

Be ready to talk through each item, justify your decisions, and explain how they meet the KSBs.
Practice answering questions that ask you to expand, clarify, or compare your work.
 
## Portfolio Evidence Overview (6x items)

This section provides a structured list of example portfolio evidence items, grouped under the four End-Point Assessment (EPA) themes defined in the Cyber Security apprenticeship standard. These examples are designed to support apprentices and employers in identifying suitable work-based projects and artefacts that demonstrate the required Knowledge, Skills, and Behaviours (KSBs).

Each theme reflects a key area of competence: The portfolio items listed under each theme are examples only and should be adapted to reflect the apprentice’s actual work and context. They are intended to guide the development of a strong, well-evidenced portfolio that supports a successful EPA. The apprenticeship standard outlines both core and pathway duties, each comprising a set of Knowledge, Skills, and Behaviours (KSBs) aligned to specific criteria or activities. These may also be helpful when selecting appropriate portfolio items for documentation.

**Colour Cyber Table**

Throughout the apprenticeship you will need to collate a portfolio of work mapped to the Standard’s KSBs, in Gateway COM628 module, the final on-programme module in 3rd (Level 6), you will submit a Portfolio of select a final 6 discrete pieces for the Professional Discussion underpinned by a portfolio assessment element 2 (AE2)

* apprentices must compile a portfolio of evidence during the on-programme period of the apprenticeship.

* it must contain evidence related to the KSBs that will be assessed by the professional discussion.

* the portfolio of evidence will typically contain 6 discrete pieces of evidence.

* evidence must be mapped against the KSBs.

* evidence may be used to demonstrate more than one KSB; a qualitative as opposed to quantitative approach is suggested.

* evidence sources may include:

* workplace documentation/records, for example workplace policies/procedures, records

* witness statements

* assignments

* annotated photographs

* video clips (maximum total duration 10 minutes); the apprentice must be in view and identifiable.

**This is not a definitive list; other evidence sources are possible.**

* **Although it is expected that apprentices at degree level will be reflective in their practice, it should be noted that the EPA assesses individuals on evidence of output against the KSBs, not reflective accounts, or any methods of self-assessment.**

* any employer contributions should focus on direct observation of performance (for example witness statements) rather than opinions.

* the evidence provided must be valid and attributable to the apprentice; the portfolio of evidence must contain a statement from the employer and apprentice confirming this.

* the portfolio of evidence must be submitted to the EPAO at the gateway.

**The portfolio of evidence is not directly assessed. It underpins the professional discussion and will not be marked by the EPAO (Southampton Solent University). Solent will review the portfolio of evidence in preparation for the professional discussion but is not required to provide feedback after this portfolio review.**
 
### Strategies for Demonstrating Knowledge, Skills & Behaviours

1.	**Use real-world, work-based examples** only no academic tasks, hobby projects, or generic online learning examples.

2.	**Speak and Write in First Person** - Always focus on **your individual contributions** use **“I”** not “we” to clearly show your personal contribution. Even in team projects, emphasise your role and decisions.
Examples: **“I volunteered to…”, “I conducted research that informed the decision…” **

3.	**Be Explicit for the Assessor** - Don’t assume they know your workplace or role. Spell out exactly what you did to meet the KSBs. Anything left unsaid won’t be assessed. 

4.	**Mirror the Assessment Plan Language** - Adopt phrases directly from the guidance (e.g. “I demonstrated my ability to…”) to make it clear how you've met specific criteria. 

5.	**Reflect on the What and the Why** - For each example, clearly explain what you did and why you did it. Generic statements are insufficient. 

6.	**Use Key Phrases to Show Depth** - Clearly explain decisions, reasoning, and outcomes, not just the task done. Focus your language around **“what”** and **“why”**, such as “I analysed, I evaluated, I implemented... because...” to enhance clarity and impact. 

7.	**Add Depth for Distinction** - To achieve higher grades, go beyond what you did and reflect on outcomes, emphasise initiative, problem-solving, and measurable results, lessons learned, and how you would refine or improve further. Demonstrate insight into future application and organisational influence.

8.	**Evidence Best Practices**
* **Use visual evidence** (screenshots, dashboards, visuals) wherever possible
* Ensure all images are **captioned** and relate clearly to your narrative.
* Apply **GDPR-compliant techniques:**
* **Redact** sensitive data.
* **Anonymise names**, addresses, IDs.
* **Normalise data** to show trends without revealing exact figures.

9.	**Demonstrating Competency**
•	Describe technical tasks in enough detail to be replicated.
•	Justify your decisions: e.g., why a tool was chosen or why certain data was excluded.
•	If results are not yet available, update portfolio pieces later — it’s a living document until submission.

10.	 **What NOT to Include**
•	Names of others — use initials or job titles.
•	Negative remarks or personal commentary.
•	Content not directly relevant to demonstrating your professional competency.

**Summary**

| **Strategy** | **What to do** |
|----|----|
| First person | Emphasise **your** actions and contributions |
| Explicit detail | Explain *exactly* what you did and why |
| Mirror plan language | Use phrasing from the assessment plan |
| Legal & Professional | Address all relevant Legal & Professional issues |
| Reflect deeply | Show insight on decisions and outcomes |
| Practice & feedback | Use mock discussions and review videos |
| STAR format\* | Structure responses clearly: Situation, Task, Action, Result |

\* The **STAR format** is a structured method for answering behavioural interview questions or presenting professional experiences, often used in performance reviews or assessments. It stands for: **Situation – Task – Action – Result.** 

**Note:** There is no obligation to use this method, only consider it if you find it helpful. It is included here because it often appears in searches for best practices in presenting apprenticeship portfolios and conducting professional discussion assessments at all levels.

### What to Expect in the Portfolio Professional Discussion EPA Assessment (AE2)

![Professional Discussion Photo](../images/interview_picts/linkedin-sales-solutions-1A8yP_5msac-unsplash_Fotor.jpg)

**Professional Discussion – Overview**
The professional discussion is a formal, two-way conversation between the apprentice and an independent assessor. It allows the apprentice to demonstrate the knowledge, skills and behaviours (KSBs) mapped to this assessment method, using examples from their portfolio of evidence. While the portfolio supports the discussion, it is not directly assessed.

**This method is chosen due to:**
The broad scope of the standard, allowing evidence to be drawn from across the programme.
The opportunity to explore the apprentice’s depth of understanding in specialist areas.

**Professional Discussion Structure**
The professional discussion follows a semi-structured format. The assessor leads the introduction, while the apprentice leads the dialogue, using their evidence portfolio

* **Introduction (5 minutes)** The assessor explains the process, checks ID, and outlines the session. This time is not included in the assessment duration.

* **Main Discussion (60 minutes +10%)** The apprentice leads the dialogue, referring to their portfolio to support their responses.

* Questions: A minimum of 4 questions will be asked, with follow-ups for clarification.

**Themes:** Questions will explore:
* Underlying Principles
* Technical Solutions
* Innovation & Response
* Legal, Ethics & Landscape

**Closure:** Opportunity for final reflections or clarifications.

*  **Delivery and Preparation**
The assessment is conducted remotely via video call.

**Apprentices should:**
* Book or be in a quiet, private room.
* Use a computer with a webcam, microphone, and stable internet.
* Have their portfolio ready for reference.

The assessor will guide the session and ensure the apprentice can achieve the highest possible grade.
