# Portfolio & KSB Mapping

gshwgshwghwg

Throughout your apprenticeship, you will be continuously mapping your learning from on-programme modules and capturing potential evidence and documentation for your work-based portfolio. This process will use the provided template and will help you build a mental model of how your work aligns with the required Knowledge, Skills, and Behaviours (KSBs), all linked to your upskilling and learning activities.

Download the portfolio mapping template for your pathway and start adding and mapping your learning on and off the job throughout your apprenticeship. Work-based projects will help you get good coverage of the KSBs, especially the behaviours. When you go to EPA you will need 6 good pieces of portfolio evidence, so the expectations are that you will have more than 6 and then select the best ones to submit for the EPA assessment.
