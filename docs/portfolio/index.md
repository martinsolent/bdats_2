# Portfolio & KSB Mapping

Throughout your apprenticeship, you will be continuously mapping your learning from on-programme modules and capturing potential evidence and documentation for your work-based portfolio. This process will use the provided template and will help you build a mental model of how your work aligns with the required Knowledge, Skills, and Behaviours (KSBs), all linked to your upskilling and learning activities.

### Portfolio Mapping Template

Download the portfolio mapping template for your pathway. Start adding your university modules and assessments, and link them to the relevant Knowledge, Skills and Behaviours (KSBs).

You should also include possible work-based projects that could be part of your End Point Assessment (EPA) submission. Youâ€™ll need six strong pieces of portfolio evidence, so aim to collect more than six and then choose the best ones for your final EPA submission.
