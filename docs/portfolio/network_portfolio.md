# Network Engineer Portfolio

The primary role of a network engineer is to lead in the planning, design, installation, maintenance and support of communication networks within an organisation or between organisations. They take a proactive and agile approach to maintain high levels of network performance and availability for their users, such as staff, clients, customers and suppliers. They understand network configuration, cloud, network administration and monitoring tools, and give technical advice and guidance to their users. As part of their role, they analyse system requirements to ensure the network, and its services operate to desired levels with security at the heart of everything they do. They understand data traffic and transmission across the network and have a major role to play in ensuring network security and resilience. They are the key problem solver when networks fail and respond with resilience under pressure.

## EPA Portfolio Assessment (Network) AI Podcast

ADD AI VIDEO

This [Google NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) AI generated podcast explains how software engineering apprentices can prepare their portfolio and professional discussion for the second assessment element of the End-Point Assessment (EPA) in the Digital and Technology Solutions apprenticeship.

It covers:

* Purpose of the portfolio – a curated set of six real-world evidence items demonstrating knowledge, skills, and behaviours (KSBs), mapped to the apprenticeship standard.

* Key themes – Network Engineering, ethical/legal compliance, organisational/business teamwork, and responding to change/innovation.

* Best practices – use first-person accounts, be explicit about your contribution, include visual evidence with captions, anonymise sensitive data, and explain both what you did and why.

* Common mistakes – being too generic, omitting the “why,” including irrelevant or unprofessional content.

* Role of the portfolio – it’s not graded directly but is the foundation for the professional discussion.

* Professional discussion format – 60 minutes, four main themes, assessor-led but apprentice-driven, using the portfolio to evidence competencies.

* Distinction tips – show reflection, measurable results, lessons learned, and growth from challenges.

* Example case – developing a web-based reporting tool in an agile environment, evidencing KSBs through active participation, leadership, and measurable impact.

The video emphasises framing the portfolio as a strategic story to support confident, evidence-backed discussion with the assessor.

[Download EPA Professional Discussion Portfolio 1.2 Overview](../info/epa_1-2_doc_2025/*)

Your portfolio should evidence your competence against the KSBs listed in the standard.
It must be mapped to six distinct items, each showcasing different aspects of your role and learning.

Choose projects that cover a range of activities, such as:
•	Network Engineering
•	Ethical and legal compliance
•	Organisational, business and team collaboration
•	Responding to change and innovation

Ensure all examples are authentic, anonymised if necessary and have organisation clearance to submit.

Explain why you did it, what you learned, and how it impacted the project or organisation.
Use reflective writing to show growth and understanding.

Include examples that show how your skills have developed over time.
Highlight how you’ve responded to feedback or adapted to new challenges.

Be ready to talk through each item, justify your decisions, and explain how they meet the KSBs.
Practice answering questions that ask you to expand, clarify, or compare your work.
 
###  Portfolio Evidence Overview (6x items)

This section provides a structured list of example portfolio evidence items, grouped under the four End-Point Assessment (EPA) themes defined in the ST0119 (version 1.2) apprenticeship standard. These examples are designed to support apprentices and employers in identifying suitable work-based projects and artefacts that demonstrate the required **Knowledge, Skills, and Behaviours (KSBs).**

**Themes** - Each theme reflects a key area of competence: The portfolio items listed under each theme are examples only and should be adapted to reflect the apprentice’s actual work and context. They are intended to guide the development of a strong, well-evidenced portfolio that supports a successful EPA. The apprenticeship standard outlines both core and pathway duties, each comprising a set of Knowledge, Skills, and Behaviours (KSBs) aligned to specific criteria or activities. These may also be helpful when selecting appropriate portfolio items for documentation.

![](../images/network_themes.png)

Throughout the apprenticeship you will need to collate a portfolio of work mapped to the Standard’s KSBs, in Gateway COM628 module, the final on-programme module in 3rd (Level 6), you will submit a Portfolio of select a final 6 discrete pieces for the Professional Discussion underpinned by a portfolio assessment element 2 (AE2)

* apprentices must compile a portfolio of evidence during the on-programme period of the apprenticeship.
* it must contain evidence related to the KSBs that will be assessed by the professional discussion.
* **the portfolio of evidence will typically contain 6 discrete pieces of evidence.**
* evidence must be mapped against the KSBs.
evidence may be used to demonstrate more than one KSB; a qualitative as opposed to quantitative approach is suggested.
* evidence sources may include:
* workplace documentation/records, for example workplace policies/procedures, records
* witness statements
* assignments
* annotated photographs
* video clips (maximum total duration 10 minutes); the apprentice must be in view and identifiable.

**This is not a definitive list; other evidence sources are possible.**

* **Although it is expected that apprentices at degree level will be reflective in their practice, it should be noted that the EPA assesses individuals on evidence of output against the KSBs, not reflective accounts, or any methods of self-assessment.**
* any employer contributions should focus on direct observation of performance (for example witness statements) rather than opinions.
* the evidence provided must be valid and attributable to the apprentice; the portfolio of evidence must contain a statement from the employer and apprentice confirming this.
* the portfolio of evidence must be submitted to the EPAO at the gateway.

**The portfolio of evidence is not directly assessed. It underpins the professional discussion and will not be marked by the EPAO (Southampton Solent University). Solent will review the portfolio of evidence in preparation for the professional discussion but is not required to provide feedback after this portfolio review.**

### Strategies for Demonstrating Knowledge, Skills & Behaviours

1.	**Use real-world, work-based examples** only no academic tasks, hobby projects, or generic online learning examples.

2.	**Speak and Write in First Person** - Always focus on **your individual contributions** use **“I”** not **“we"** to clearly show your personal contribution. Even in team projects, emphasise your role and decisions.
Examples: **“I volunteered to…”, “I conducted research that informed the decision…”**

3.	**Be Explicit for the Assessor** - Don’t assume they know your workplace or role. Spell out exactly what you did to meet the KSBs. Anything left unsaid won’t be assessed. 

4.	**Mirror the Assessment Plan Language** - Adopt phrases directly from the guidance (e.g. “I demonstrated my ability to…”) to make it clear how you've met specific criteria. 

5.	**Reflect on the What and the Why** - For each example, clearly explain what you did and why you did it. Generic statements are insufficient. 

6.	**Use Key Phrases to Show Depth** - Clearly explain decisions, reasoning, and outcomes, not just the task done. Focus your language around **“what”** and **“why”**, such as “**I analysed, I evaluated, I implemented... because...”** to enhance clarity and impact. 

7.	**Add Depth for Distinction** - To achieve higher grades, go beyond what you did and reflect on outcomes, emphasise initiative, problem-solving, and measurable results, lessons learned, and how you would refine or improve further. Demonstrate insight into future application and organisational influence.

8.	**Evidence Best Practices**
* **Use visual evidence** (screenshots, dashboards, visuals) wherever possible
* Ensure all images are **captioned** and relate clearly to your narrative.
* Apply **GDPR-compliant techniques:**
* **Redact** sensitive data.
* **Anonymise names**, addresses, IDs.
* **Normalise data** to show trends without revealing exact figures.

9.	**Demonstrating Competency**
•	Describe technical tasks in enough detail to be replicated.
•	Justify your decisions: e.g., why a tool was chosen or why certain data was excluded.
•	If results are not yet available, update portfolio pieces later — it’s a living document until submission.

10.	 **What NOT to Include**
•	Names of others — use initials or job titles.
•	Negative remarks or personal commentary.
•	Content not directly relevant to demonstrating your professional competency.

**Summary**

| **Strategy** | **What to do** |
|----|----|
| First person | Emphasise **your** actions and contributions |
| Explicit detail | Explain *exactly* what you did and why |
| Mirror plan language | Use phrasing from the assessment plan |
| Legal & Professional | Address all relevant Legal & Professional issues |
| Reflect deeply | Show insight on decisions and outcomes |
| Practice & feedback | Use mock discussions and review videos |
| STAR format\* | Structure responses clearly: Situation, Task, Action, Result |

\* The **STAR format** is a structured method for answering behavioural interview questions or presenting professional experiences, often used in performance reviews or assessments. It stands for: **Situation – Task – Action – Result.** 

**Note:** There is no obligation to use this method, only consider it if you find it helpful. It is included here because it often appears in searches for best practices in presenting apprenticeship portfolios and conducting professional discussion assessments at all levels.

### What to Expect in the Portfolio Professional Discussion EPA Assessment (AE2)

![Professional Discussion Photo](../images/interview_picts/amy-hirschi-JaoVGh5aJ3E-unsplash_Fotor.jpg)

**Professional Discussion – Overview**
The professional discussion is a formal, two-way conversation between the apprentice and an independent assessor. It allows the apprentice to demonstrate the knowledge, skills and behaviours (KSBs) mapped to this assessment method, using examples from their portfolio of evidence. While the portfolio supports the discussion, it is not directly assessed.

**This method is chosen due to:**
The broad scope of the standard, allowing evidence to be drawn from across the programme.
The opportunity to explore the apprentice’s depth of understanding in specialist areas.

**Professional Discussion Structure**
The professional discussion follows a semi-structured format. The assessor leads the introduction, while the apprentice leads the dialogue, using their evidence portfolio

* **Introduction (5 minutes)** The assessor explains the process, checks ID, and outlines the session. This time is not included in the assessment duration.

* **Main Discussion (60 minutes +10%)** The apprentice leads the dialogue, referring to their portfolio to support their responses.

* Questions: A minimum of 4 questions will be asked, with follow-ups for clarification.

**Themes:** Questions will explore:
* Underlying Principles
* Technical Solutions
* Innovation & Response
* Legal, Ethics & Landscape

**Closure:** Opportunity for final reflections or clarifications.

*  **Delivery and Preparation**
The assessment is conducted remotely via video call.

**Apprentices should:**
* Book or be in a quiet, private room.
* Use a computer with a webcam, microphone, and stable internet.
* Have their portfolio ready for reference.

The assessor will guide the session and ensure the apprentice can achieve the highest possible grade.

### KSBs Assessed via Professional Discussion 

These are KSB learning outcomes that will need to be mapped to in this assessment for full details on KSB Professional Discussion assessment: [Appendix A](#appendix-a)

| Category | Type | KSBs |
|----|----|----|
| Core | Knowledge | K6, K7, K8, K9, K10, K11, K12, K13, K14, K16, K19, K20 |
| Core | Skills | S4, S7, S8, S9, S10, S11, S12, S15 |
| Core | Behaviours | B1, B2, B4, B6, B7, B8 |
| Network Engineer | Knowledge | K63, K64, K65, K67, K68 |
| Network Engineer | Skills | S58, S59, S61 |

**Note:** The documentation within the standard also refers to pathway learning outcomes using different codes; however, these are equivalent to the ones listed below. The following is a consolidated list of the main knowledge and skills outcomes, along with their corresponding pathway learning outcome codes as presented in the standard documentation.

K63(NEK3) K64(NEK4) K65(NEK5) K67(NEK7) K68(NEK8)

### Grading Professional Discussion EPA Assessment (AE2)

This is the second of two EPA assessment elements, and it has its own grading rubric - [Appendix B](#appendix-b). You’ll receive a grade of Distinction, Pass or Fail for each element, which will contribute to your overall result as shown in the column on the right. A numeric score will also be given for both assessments, and these will be used to calculate your overall degree average and classification in line with university guidelines.

| **Project Report   with presentation, questions and answers** | **Professional   Discussion underpinned by a portfolio** | **Overall Grading** |
| :------------------------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------- |

| **Any grade**                                                | **Fail**                                                 | **Fail**            |
| **Pass**                                                     | **Pass**                                                 | **Pass**            |
| **Pass**                                                     | **Distinction**                                          | **Merit**           |
| **Distinction**                                              | **Pass**                                                 | **Merit**           |
| **Distinction**                                              | **Distinction**                                          | **Distinction**     |

### EPA Portfolio Network Template

[Download EPA Network Portfolio 1.2 Template 2025-v2](../info/epa_1-2_doc_2025/Template_SE_AE2_NEW_25_v3.docx)

Throughout your apprenticeship, you will be continuously mapping your learning from on-programme modules and capturing potential evidence and documentation for your work-based portfolio. This process will use the provided template and will help you build a mental model of how your work aligns with the required Knowledge, Skills, and Behaviours (KSBs), all linked to your upskilling and learning activities.

As you approach the End-Point Assessment (EPA), you will need to select **six of your strongest portfolio items.** For each item, you will create a narrative documentation that clearly links the work to the relevant KSBs for the **Professional Discussion (AE2).**

You will be given a template to support this process. Below is an example of one of the sections (or "blocks") included in the template. These blocks - [Appendix C](#appendix-c) are designed to help you:

* Map your work to the appropriate KSBs
* Apply the correct assessment criteria
* Ensure coverage of **all required themes** within the assessment

This structured approach will help you demonstrate your competence and readiness for the EPA.

**Using KSB Theme Blocks in Your Portfolio Template**
The portfolio template includes blocks outlining the assessment criteria and the Core and Pathway (Specialism) KSBs for each of the four required themes.
These blocks should be copied and pasted at the end of the narrative for each of your six portfolio items.

![Theme D](../images/SE_PORTFOLIO/D_3_BLOCK.png)

Image: Example of Theme (KSB) block

**Apprenticeship Statement of Authenticity**

Before submission, both apprentice and employer must complete a **Statement of Authenticity** at the end of this Portfolio Template document. This confirms that the work is your own and reflects your learning and development throughout the programme.

Any organisational clearance or rights to publishing must be discussed with the Solent support tutors before the Gateway submission for this assessment.

Please note yellow highlights indicate where diagrams and links to supporting evidence will appear in the final portfolio and KSB theme blocks have been appended to the end of the narrative description.

**Item 1: Requirements Analysis for Network Solutions
Reflecting on My Approach to Stakeholder Engagement and Requirements Gathering for Network Design**

**Overview:**
In this portfolio item, I demonstrate my understanding of organisational context and collaborative working through a requirements analysis project for a network upgrade. I reflect on how I engaged stakeholders, analysed business needs, and applied leadership and professional behaviours to deliver a solution aligned with strategic goals. This example supports Theme A: Underlying Principles, specifically focusing on **[K7, K8, K9, K10, S7, S8, B4, B6, B7].**

{: .highlight }
> Insert Diagram 1: Requirements Analysis Workflow
A visual showing stages from stakeholder engagement to documented requirements.

**Situation:**
Our organisation planned to expand its operations across two new regional offices. The existing network infrastructure was insufficient to support the anticipated increase in traffic, remote access, and security requirements. I was tasked with leading the requirements analysis phase to inform the design of a scalable and secure network solution.

**Task:**
My responsibility was to gather and analyse technical and business requirements, engage with stakeholders across departments, and produce a requirements specification document to guide the network design phase.

**Actions:**

**Understanding the Organisational Context [K7]:**

I began by reviewing the organisation’s strategic IT roadmap and current infrastructure documentation. I conducted interviews with department heads to understand operational needs and constraints.

*	Stakeholder Interview Notes (Redacted)

**“I demonstrated my understanding of the organisational context by aligning network requirements with business expansion goals and operational needs.”**

**Working Effectively in a Team [K8, S7, B4, B6, B7]:**

I collaborated with IT support, cybersecurity, and facilities teams to gather input and validate assumptions. We used collaborative tools like Microsoft Teams and Confluence to share findings and track progress.

**“I applied leadership principles by managing stakeholder engagement, prioritising requirements, and ensuring alignment with organisational strategy.”**

**Results:**
The final requirements document was approved by senior management and used to guide the network design and procurement phases. The clarity and structure of the document reduced delays and improved vendor engagement.

**Supporting Evidence (embedded or links to):**

*	Approval Email from IT Director 
*	Vendor Feedback Summary

**Reflection and Lessons Learned:**
This experience reinforced the importance of structured stakeholder engagement and clear documentation. I learned that early collaboration and prioritisation frameworks are essential for successful network planning. In future projects, I would introduce stakeholder personas to better anticipate needs.

**“I reflected on the effectiveness of stakeholder engagement and prioritisation, identifying improvements such as using personas and earlier validation checkpoints.”**

**KSBs Demonstrated:**

*	**K7:** Analysed organisational roles and strategic goals to inform network requirements.
*	**K8, S7:** Collaborated across departments using digital tools and shared documentation.
*	**K9, K10, S8:** Led workshops, prioritised requirements, and managed stakeholder relationships.
*	**B4, B6, B7:** Demonstrated adaptability, collaboration, and commitment to continuous improvement.

**Grading - Professional Discussion underpinned by a portfolio**

This grading rubric applies to the Professional Discussion assessment, which is based on your six-item portfolio. Each item in your portfolio must clearly map to the relevant Knowledge, Skills, and Behaviours (KSBs) required for this assessment element.

Your portfolio will be submitted at the Gateway stage as you enter the End Point Assessment (EPA) period. It is essential that:
* Your portfolio aligns directly with the specified KSBs.
* You are prepared to expand on and clarify how your work demonstrates these KSBs during the discussion.
* This ensures that assessors can confidently evaluate your competence against both Pass and Distinction criteria›

### Appendix C

**KSB Professional Discussion underpinned by a portfolio Mapping Blocks**

KSB mapping blocks are tools used to align portfolio evidence with the specific Knowledge, Skills, and Behaviours (KSBs) required by the assessment criteria. These blocks play a crucial role in ensuring that each item in the portfolio clearly demonstrates how it meets the relevant standards.

Below are examples of Knowledge, Skills, and Behaviours (KSB) mapping blocks. These will be used in the portfolio assessment template to show how each piece of evidence supports the associated KSBs within each theme. The following examples illustrate how to use these blocks effectively throughout the assessment process.
