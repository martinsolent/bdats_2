# The STAR Method

![Discussion](../images/linkedin-sales-solutions-W3Jl3jREpDY-unsplash.jpg)

For the **EPA Professional Discussion underpinned by portfolio assessment (AE2)**, you don’t have to use the STAR method, as long as your portfolio items are consistent. However, when you look online for advice on presentations, interviews, discussions, or preparing for a **Professional Discussion in an apprenticeship EPA**, the STAR method often comes up.

It’s also a helpful approach in other parts of your apprenticeship and in the workplace. The guidance and support documents for this assessment include an example that follows the STAR method structure.

When you're asked to describe something you've done in your past work, we’re not just looking for a quick answer—we want to hear the full story. A strong response gives insight into how you think, act, and solve problems. It should include:

- **Context** – What was happening, and what was your role?
- **Task** – What were you trying to achieve?
- **Actions** – What did you do to move things forward?
- **Outcome** – What was the result? What did you learn?

We’re not expecting perfect answers or rehearsed scripts. It’s the assessor or interviewer’s job to guide the conversation and get the details they need. But if you understand the kind of information we’re looking for, it can help the discussion flow more naturally.

The STAR method a useful tool to help you organise your thoughts and tell a story that highlights your strengths.

## STAR Breakdown

- **S = Situation**  
  Set the scene. What was happening? Where were you working, studying, or volunteering? What challenge were you facing? Give just enough background so we understand the big picture and why the situation was interesting or difficult.

- **T = Task**  
  What was your goal? What were you responsible for? This helps us understand your role and what you were trying to achieve.

- **A = Action**  
  Walk us through what you did. What steps did you take? How did you approach the challenge? Focus on your individual contributions—even if you were part of a team. It’s helpful to use “I” instead of “we.”

- **R = Result**  
  What was the outcome? What happened because of your actions? Don’t be shy—share what you achieved and what you learned. If you have any numbers or specific results to back it up, even better.

## Tips for Using STAR

- Keep each section concise but detailed enough to show impact.
- Use real, recent examples that are relevant to the role or competency being assessed.
- For **distinction-level** responses (e.g., in apprenticeships or interviews), highlight initiative, problem-solving, and measurable results.

Frame your answers in relation to the [Leadership Principles]([https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en-gb/-principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles)) And remember, not every story has to be a success. Failure is part of innovation. What matters is what you learned and how you grew.
