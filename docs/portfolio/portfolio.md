This section provides comprehensive guidance for apprentices undertaking the BSc Digital and Technology Solutions Professional under the ST0119 v1.2 (2023) apprenticeship standard. It outlines the expectations and structure of the Professional Discussion underpinned by a Portfolio (Assessment Element 2).

Apprentices are required to compile a portfolio of six distinct, work-based evidence items, each mapped to specific Knowledge, Skills, and Behaviours (KSBs). The document details how to select, structure, and present these items using reflective writing and real-world examples, supported by visual artefacts and anonymised data.

The guidance includes:

* Thematic breakdown of portfolio evidence (Underlying Principles, Technical Solutions, Innovation & Response, Legal & Ethics).

* Strategies for demonstrating competency, including use of first-person narrative, and alignment with assessment criteria.

* Detailed KSB mapping tables and grading rubrics to support preparation for the professional discussion.
