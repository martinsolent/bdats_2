# Network Systems Automation COM511

### ### Why is this module important?

Most companies are highly dependent on applications that run over a computer network which in turn can be highly dependent on an operating environment consisting of complex pre-requisites. Systems and services must be configured that are vital to the operation of applications and the network. Management tasks may be run remotely to centralise the control and configuration of systems and services. It is vital that the configuration of systems and devices should be centrally stored and updated so that in the event of system failure this can be quickly restored to the relevant part of the network. This is known as Configuration Management and is one of the methods used in a DevOps role, where an IT specialist has knowledge of application, the environment in which they run and the network. 

Centralised configuration also extends to the control of network devices such as routers and switches. A Software Defined Network (SDN) involves the use of a centralised SDN Controller to determine the routes taken by traffic rather than permitting switches or routers to autonomously decide where to send traffics. 

Some network functions can even be virtualised in software rather than hosted on physical devices. Data centres are using this paradigm to provide dynamic networks that respond much more fluidly to the changing demands of high bandwidth network traffic. Operating systems may be also be hosted using virtualisation in the form of virtual machines or containers. A good awareness of these network automation and configuration management technologies is essential for anyone involved with computer networks and administration or systems related to data centres or a DevOps role.

### What you will learn on this module

**Network System Principles, Services and Configuration**
Operating systems and kernels: overview of operating systems contrasting server based such as Windows and Linux, network device based such as WeOS and IOS, mobile device based such as Android and embedded systems such as Arduino. System services and server roles. 
Software Defined Networks** with centralised control versus legacy networks with autonomous control. Industrial networks, provision for resilience and management.

**Applications and Management of Network Systems**
The principles of centralised network administration, management and automation, including DevOps. General considerations of security in management of network systems. Looking at case studies in production and industrial network environments. The role of Software Defined Networks in datacentres and the tools used to manage them, for example OpenDaylight. Introducing the methods used to provide resilience and the tools used to manage their configuration. Configuration management of production networks using tools such as Ansible or Chef. Tools used to monitor and manage networks, such as OpenNMS. 


### What you will be able to do after the module:

1.	Discuss a wide range of aspects of network systems and the services that they provide to the network
2.	Analyse techniques for automation of computers systems and networks
3.	Implement, troubleshoot and manage network systems using appropriate tools and techniques. 
4.	Formulate and apply solutions to real world problems
5.	Communicate information relating to network systems effectively.
