# Apprenticeships: off-the-job training

![otj Banner](../images/otj.png)

Off-the-job training is a statutory requirement for an English apprenticeship and must make up at least 20% of an apprentice’s normal working hours (paid hours excluding overtime) over the planned duration of the apprenticeship.

It is training that is received by the apprentice, during the apprentice’s normal working hours, for the purpose of achieving the knowledge, skills, and behaviours of the approved apprenticeship referenced in the apprenticeship agreement.

***How employers and training providers should meet the off-the-job training requirement for apprentices, with some best practice examples.***

**GOV.UK., 2023.** Apprenticeships: off-the-job training [viewed 30 October 2023]. 
Available from: [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apprenticeships-off-the-job-training](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6530efdb92895c000ddcba2b/2023_10_OTJT_Guide_v5_-_23_24_Rules_v1.0.pdf)

An apprenticeship is a job with a formal programme of off-the-job training. **Off-the-job** 
training is an essential component, and a [legal requirement,](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2017/1310/contents/made) of an apprenticeship. In 
England, to be eligible for government funding, a minimum threshold has been set. 

All new full-time apprentices (those who work at least 30 hours per week) 
must spend at least 20% of their normal working hours, over the planned 
duration of the apprenticeship practical period, on off-the-job training.**For 
calculation purposes only, normal working hours are capped at 30 hours per 
week,** which equates to an average of 6 hours of off-the-job training per week 
(i.e. 20% of 30 hours). **Apprentices can work for more than 30 hours per week 
for their employer.**

If an individual works less than 30 hours per week, they are considered to be a 
part-time apprentice and their training programme must be extended, as per 
the [apprenticeship funding rules](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apprenticeship-funding-rules). At least 20% of their normal working hours, 
over this extended duration, must be spent on off-the-job training

It can be flexible and doesn’t have to mean 1 day out of the workplace every week.

**For example, training could take place:**

* online
* at the apprentice’s place of work
* at a college or university or with a training provider
* Or it could be a combination of these options.

**The frequency can vary, for example:**

* 1 day a week
* part of a working day
* blocks of time
* For instance, some apprenticeships begin with a block of training to get the apprentice work-ready.

You can agree on a suitable training schedule to suit the needs of your business with your training provider.

### English and maths
Your apprentice may also need to study for maths and English qualifications as part of their apprenticeship.
You must allow your apprentice time to study for this within their normal working hours.
Studying English and maths is not counted as part of the 20% minimum off-the-job training requirement.

### Apprenticeship Training Plan
**Previously called a commitment statement**, the training plan sets out the training to be delivered and the commitment of all three parties (provider, employer and apprentice) to the programme. It can also be used to record key details such as the employer’s agreement to release the apprentice for their off-the-job training. The apprenticeship funding rules detail what information is needed in the training plan and all parties must keep a current signed and dated version.

**This must include:**

* the planned content and schedule for training
* what is expected and offered by the employer, the training organisation and the apprentice
* how to resolve queries or complaints
