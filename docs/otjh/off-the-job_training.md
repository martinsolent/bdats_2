### Apprenticeship funding rules 2023/2024:

When calculating the required amount of off-the-job training, the  apprentice’s statutory leave entitlement must be deducted. 

Employees who work a 5-day week receive **28 days paid statutory leave** (20 days annual leave plus 8 bank holidays), which is the equivalent of  **5.6 weeks of holiday**. The apprentice’s own annual leave entitlement,  which may be higher than the statutory leave allowance, must not be  used in the calculation. 

Therefore, for a full-time apprentice following a 12-month apprenticeship, off-the-job training is delivered over **46.4 weeks** (52 weeks minus 5.6  weeks of statutory leave).
