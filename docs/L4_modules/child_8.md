### Why is this module important?

Software testing is a vital part of the software lifecycle. If software does not work as expected then this can lead to problems resulting in a loss of time, money and reputation.

Testing is not strictly about running tests and looking for logic errors. It is a process consisting of many different practices that need to be understood.
Knowledge in testing will help you build more robust and reliable software that meets the expectations of both users and clients.

### What you will learn on the module

You will learn about the testing process and the different types of tests that are commonly used, these will include component/module testing, usability testing and user acceptance testing.

You will also analyse requirements and develop testing strategies for given circumstances and youâ€™ll get hands on with number of tools that will aid you in the testing process.
 
### How you will learn?

This module attempts to underpin the underlying theory of testing processes and how this is applied in practice. As such, your first session each week will start with the lecturer presenting the topic and delivering the important concepts that you will need to know for that week. Then you will have the opportunity to apply these practices in a computer lab.

You will also have access to resources and support material which will be published to Solent Online Learning to aid you in your studies. 



### What you will be able to do after the module

1.	Explain the different approaches to testing
2.	Identify and apply appropriate testing practices
3.	Select and use appropriate testing tools
4.	Analyse requirements and design appropriate testing strategies
5.	Evaluate selected tools and test plans
