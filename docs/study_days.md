# Study Days

![windows-v94mlgvsza4-unsplash.jpg](./images/windows-v94mlgvsza4-unsplash.jpg)

The Academic year is delivered over 3 semesters with BDATS 2 modules &  HNC L4 1 module per semester 

[Solent University Academic calendar for 2025-26](https://students.solent.ac.uk/official-documents/policy-governance-and-information/academic-calendar-2025-26.pdf){: .btn .btn-purple }

**What will be my university study day?**

As a default we aim to have first years on Tuesdays, second years on Wednesdays and Thursdays for third years, **but due demand on resources this is not always possible, but we will confirm study days in advance of you starting the course or progressing to the next level/year.**
