### Advice to give to an Apprentice

* Note that Withdrawal from Study means permanently ceasing your studies on this course at Solent University
* You could consider a break in learning/suspension of studies rather than withdrawing from your apprenticeship.
* You can seek guidance from your course leader, or a tutor, or speak to your employer.

### Advice to give to an Employer

* In accordance with education and skills funding agency (ESFA) Guidelines, it is the employerâ€™s responsibility to notify the training provider of the withdrawal or break in learning for one of their apprentices.
* You are advised to review the ESFA rules before completing this form.
* Please note that you are responsible for amending the DAS to show this withdrawal.
