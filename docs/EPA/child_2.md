# EPA Work Based Project


Project (AE1)- A project involves the apprentice completing a significant and defined piece of work that has a real business application and benefit. 

 **The project may be undertaken pre-gateway, however, the Project Report must be completed after the apprentice has gone through the gateway.**

The apprentice will scope out and provide a summary of what the project will cover and will submit this at the gateway. This should demonstrate that the work-based project report will provide sufficient opportunity for the apprentice to meet the KSBs mapped to this method. The summary is not formally assessed and will typically be no longer than 500 words.

The project proposal needs to include a summary of the project plan, research requirements, an overview of how the project will be planned to include timeframes and the date the work-based project report must be submitted to the independent assessor


The Endpoint Assessment takes place in the final 3 months of the apprenticeship following on from the "on-programme" delivery after COM628.

**To move into the EPA period you need to have completed and submitted the off-the-job tracker, Portfolio, EPA ready form & Employer feedback reference - these will need to be checked before the final EPA assessment can be booked.**  
  
We will encourage apprentices and their employers to think about suitable project areas for the synoptic project end of the 2nd year and the beginning of the 3rd year as you should spend approximately 6 months preparing and working on your project.

Support for the EPA (COM627) takes place in the final Digital and Technology Solutions Gateway COM628 module which will also prepare you for gateway EPA in completing your portfolio, gathering all required documents, and creating a "dry run" presentation.
