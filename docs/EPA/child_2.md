![](../images/ej-yao-D46mXLsQRJw-unsplash.jpg)

Solent University, East Park Terrace, Southampton, SO14 0YN   **[End Point Assessor Organisation (EPAO) ID: EPA0325](https://find-epao.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/courses/25/assessment-organisations/epa0325)**

**Project (AE1)** - A project involves the apprentice completing a significant and defined piece of work that has a real business application and benefit. 

 **The project may be undertaken pre-gateway, however, the Project Report must be completed after the apprentice has gone through the gateway and in the EPA period (3 months approx.)**

The apprentice will scope out and provide a summary of what the project will cover and will submit this at the gateway. This should demonstrate that the work-based project report will provide sufficient opportunity for the apprentice to meet the **KSBs** mapped to this method. The summary is not formally assessed and will typically be no longer than **500 words**.

The project proposal needs to include a summary of the project plan, research requirements, an overview of how the project will be planned to include timeframes and the date the work-based project report must be submitted to the independent assessor
