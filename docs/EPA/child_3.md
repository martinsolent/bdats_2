![](../images/christina-wocintechchat-com-eF7HN40WbAQ-unsplash.jpg)

Throughout the apprenticeship you will need to keep a portfolio of work mapped to the standard KSBs, before Gateway at the enmd of the apprenticeship you will need to **select 6 discrete pieces of evidence** for EPA assessment element 2 (AE2)

#### Overview
In the professional discussion, an independent assessor and apprentice have a formal two-way conversation. It gives the apprentice the opportunity to demonstrate the KSBs mapped to this assessment method.

The apprentice can refer to and illustrate their answers with evidence from their portfolio of evidence.
Rationale

This assessment method is being used because:
* breadth of the core of the standard and opportunities to evidence across this throughout the duration of the programme
* allows the opportunity to explore depth of understanding surrounding the relevant specialist KSBs.

#### Delivery
The professional discussion must be structured to give the apprentice the opportunity to demonstrate the KSBs mapped to this assessment method to the highest available grade.
An independent assessor must conduct and assess the professional discussion.

The purpose of the independent assessor's questions will be to explore the following topics and themes:

**Theme A**: Underlying Principles
**Theme B:** Technical Solutions
**Theme C:** Innovation & Response
**Theme D:** Legal, Ethics & Landscape

The EPAO (Solent University) must give an apprentice **14 days notice** of the professional discussion.

The independent assessor must have at **least 2 weeks** to review the supporting documentation.

The apprentice must have access to their portfolio of evidence during the professional discussion.

The apprentice can refer to and illustrate their answers with evidence from their portfolio of evidence however, the portfolio of evidence is not directly assessed.

T**he professional discussion must last for 60 minutes.** The independent assessor can increase the time of the professional discussion by up to 10%. This time is to allow the apprentice to respond to a question if necessary.

The independent assessor must ask at least 4 questions. Follow-up questions are allowed where clarification is required. The independent assessor must use the questions from their EPAO’s question bank or create their own questions in-line with the EPAO’s training.

The independent assessor must make the grading decision. The independent assessor must keep accurate records of the assessment. They must record:
* the apprentice’s answers to questions
* the KSBs demonstrated in answers to questions.
* the grade achieved. 
 

#### Assessment location
The professional discussion must take place in a suitable venue selected by the EPAO (for example the EPAO’s or employer’s premises).

The professional discussion can be conducted by video conferencing. The EPAO must have processes in place to verify the identity of the apprentice and ensure the apprentice is not being aided.

The professional discussion should take place in a quiet room, free from distractions and influence.
