# Assessment Principles & Regulations 

Assessment describes any processes that appraise an individualâ€™s knowledge, understanding, abilities, skills or behaviours. There are many forms of assessment, serving a variety of purposes. These include: 

1. promoting student learning by providing the student with feedback, to help improve their performance;
2.  evaluating student knowledge, understanding, abilities or skills; providing a mark or grade which enables a student's performance to be established. The mark or grade may also be used to make progress decisions;
3.  and enabling the public (including employers) and higher education providers, to know that an individual ha s attained an appropriate level of achievement that reflects the academic standards set by the awarding institution and agreed UK norms, including the Frameworks for Higher Education Qualifications. This may include demonstrating fitness to practice or meeting other professional requirements.
