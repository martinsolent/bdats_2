# Portfolio

**Submit a Portfolio of evidence for the professional discussion underpinned by a portfolio.**

* apprentices must compile a portfolio of evidence during the on-programme period of the apprenticeship.
* it must contain evidence related to the KSBs that will be assessed by the professional discussion.
* the portfolio of evidence will typically contain 6 discrete pieces of evidence.
* evidence must be mapped against the KSBs.
* evidence may be used to demonstrate more than one KSB; a qualitative as opposed to quantitative approach is suggested.
* evidence sources may include:
* workplace documentation/records, for example workplace policies/procedures, records
* witness statements
* assignments
* annotated photographs
* video clips (maximum total duration 10 minutes); the apprentice must be in view and identifiable.

**This is not a definitive list; other evidence sources are possible.**

* Although it is expected that apprentices at degree level will be reflective in their practice, it should be noted that the EPA assesses individuals on evidence of output against the KSBs, not reflective accounts, or any methods of self-assessment.
* any employer contributions should focus on direct observation of performance (for example witness statements) rather than opinions.
* the evidence provided must be valid and attributable to the apprentice; the portfolio of evidence must contain a statement from the employer and apprentice confirming this.
* the portfolio of evidence must be submitted to the EPAO at the gateway.

The portfolio of evidence is not directly assessed. It underpins the professional discussion and therefore should not be marked by the EPAO (Solent University). Solent will review the portfolio of evidence in preparation for the professional discussion but are not required to provide feedback after this review of the portfolio.
