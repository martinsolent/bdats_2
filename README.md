## The apprenticeship offers four pathways from 2022, depending on your job role:

* Software Engineer
* Network Engineer 
* Data Analyst 
* Cybersecurity Specialist
<!--- * IT Consultant * Business Analyst --->

### Software Engineer

![Software Engineer](images/trello_course_structure_images_2020_0010_se.png)

A software engineer needs to be able to design, develop, build and test high-quality software solutions. This role requires apprentices to apply engineering principles at all levels of the software development process. This includes requirement gathering, analysis and design, development and data requirements, while ensuring security robustness is built in. Software engineers typically work as part of a larger collaborative team and will have responsibility for significant elements of software projects.

### Network Engineer

![Network Engineer](images/trello_course_structure_images_2020_0009_network.png)


The primary role of a network engineer is to design, install, maintain and support communication networks within an organisation or between organisations. They need to maintain high levels of network performance and availability for users. They must also understand network configuration, cloud, network administration, and monitoring tools, and be able to give technical advice and guidance. Network engineers must be proficient in technology solutions to be able to analyse system requirements to ensure the network and its services operate to desired levels. Network engineers also understand data traffic and transmission across the network and have a major role to play in ensuring network security.

### Data Analyst

![Data Analyst](images/trello_course_structure_images_2020_0002_nesa-by-makers-IgUR1iX0mqM-unsplash.png)

The role of a data analyst is to collect, organise and study data that can provide new business insight. This data is then compiled and used to inform decision making at all levels of the business. A data analyst is involved with managing, cleansing, abstracting and aggregate data across the network infrastructure. They also have a good understanding of data structures, software development procedures and the tools used to undertake standard and custom analytical studies, providing data solutions to a range of business issues.

### Cyber Security Specialist

![Cyber Security Specialist](images/trello_course_structure_images_2020_0011_cyber.png)

A cyber security specialist is responsible for the implementation, maintenance and support of the security controls that protect an organisationâ€™s systems and data assets, ensuring security technologies and practices are operating in accordance with the organisation's policies and standards to provide continued protection. They are responsible for performing vulnerability assessments to evaluate an organisation's ongoing security and provide visibility to management of the main risks and control status on an ongoing basis. They also respond to security incidents and implement resolution activities across an organisation. Cyber security specialists require a broad understanding of network infrastructure, software and data to identify where threat and hazard can occur.

![IT Consultant](images/christin-hume-mfB1B1s4sMc-unsplash.jpg)

IT consultants require a broad set of skills in areas such as business analysis, solutions development, network infrastructure, data, and cyber security. They use their consulting skills to advise clients on how to best utilise technology to meet business objectives and increase productivity. They also provide strategic guidance with regard to technology, and facilitate changing business processes through enhancements to technology solutions. IT consultants also provide technical assistance and often provide training.

### Business Analyst

![Business Analyst](images/pc1.jpg)

Business analysts are responsible for assessing the impact of change - capturing, analysing and documenting requirements; and working with stakeholders to deliver projects that meet business requirements. They create detailed analysis of systems to make recommendations for improvement and produce specifications of user requirements that enable software engineers to develop the right software solutions. They require a broad set of skills and knowledge to be able to be effective as their work incorporates all aspects of digital technology systems.
